#From multi-service IronWare Switching Configuration Guide (53-1003036-02):
#- Enable a port to act as the mirror port.  This is the port to which you connect your protocol analyzer
#- Enable monitoring on the ports you want to monitor
#
#Therefore, configured mirroring and monitoring requires one to 
#1. Enter global configuration mode using "config t"
#2. Configure the "mirror-port eth <port-designator>" command
#3. Enter interface config mode for the port to be monitored using "interface eth <monitored-port-designator>"
#4. Configure monitoring using "monitor ethernet <mirror-port-designator> [in|out|both]"
#
#To use this template, replace each instance in the text below with its corresponding value,
#then designate the correct value in the [in|out|both] section

config t
mirror-port eth <MIRROR_PORT_DESIGNATOR>

interface eth <MONITOR_PORT_DESIGNATOR>
monitor ethernet <MIRROR_PORT_DESIGNATOR> [in|out|both]
